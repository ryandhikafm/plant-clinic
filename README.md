# Plant-Clinic : A Web Application for Plant Diseases Classification and Recommendation with Convolutional Neural Network

# Model Accuracy Reaches 94%


## Background
Indonesia is a country that is blessed with very fertile natural conditions. Of course, this natural condition is used by many people to grow crops, either farming or gardening. Some make it their main job, and some make it a hobby, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's call for #DiRumahAja activities to increase farming activities, whether just to beautify the home page or to get a source of guaranteed quality fruits and vegetables. As tech enthusiasts, this phenomenon is very interesting for me. Marrying the agricultural sector with technology has always been an open opportunity to serve the country. I do not agree with the view that the agricultural and plantation sectors are sectors that are only active by the middle and lower economic class, I believe that with the right technology, agricultural products will be of better quality, greater in quantity, and the more extraordinary the impact on the country's economy. A way for me who want to serve our beloved country. Therefore, as data science activists, I try to process and utilize the available data to produce products that can be used to support farming activities. Introducing the product, Plant Clinic. 


## Concept
Plant Clinic is a web app that can detect diseases in plants. With the image recognition feature, if you upload photos of your plants to this website, the computer can detect whether your plants are healthy or sick. Then, if sick, of course the question will arise, what disease attacks this plant? What caused it? How to handle it? Then, how to prevent it from attacking again in the future? Everything can be found on this website. So far, the plants that the disease can detect are apples, cherries, corn, grapes, peaches, peppers, potatoes, strawberries, and tomatoes. Of course, I am always collecting information about other plants, because the more types of plants I can detect, and the more data, of course, the better products will arise.
